## GENERAL RECORDS SCHEDULE </br>GENERAL INFORMATION AND INSTRUCTIONS

### FOREWORD

The **general records schedules** established by the Department of State are intended for use by state,
county, city and special district public records custodians. If you are unsure of your organization’s status
as a “public agency,” consult your legal counsel and/or the Florida Attorney General’s Office for a legal
opinion. The Department of State publishes the following general records schedules:

```
GS1-SL State and Local Government Agencies
GS5    Public Universities and Colleges
GS7    Public Schools Pre-K-12 and Adult and Career Education
```


All Florida public agencies are eligible to use the GS1-SL, which provides retention periods for the most
common administrative records, such as routine correspondence and personnel, payroll, financial and
legal records. General records schedules GS2 through GS15 are applicable to program records of
specific functional areas, such as elections administration, tax collecting or law enforcement, each of
which has unique program responsibilities and thus unique records retention requirements. The GS2
through GS15 should be used in conjunction with the GS1-SL to cover as many administrative and
program records as possible.

The retention periods set forth in the general records schedules are based on federal and state laws and
regulations, general administrative practices and fiscal management principles. Please note that these
are **minimum** retention periods; public agencies may retain their records longer at their discretion. In fact,
certain accreditation committees may have standards that require longer retention periods. Contact your
accrediting organization for more information on their requirements. In addition, federal, state or local
laws and regulations regarding recordkeeping and records retention for specific agencies or specific types
of records might require a longer retention than indicated in this general schedule. Agencies should be
aware of all laws and regulations relating to their records and recordkeeping requirements. However,
remember that a public agency is not permitted to **reduce** the retention periods stated in a general
records schedule.

For additional information on records retention and disposition, please refer to Managing Florida’s Public
Records handbook, which, along with all Florida general records schedules, is available on the
Department of State’s Records Management website at info.florida.gov/records-management/.
